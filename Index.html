<h1> Sex In The City series is back </h1>

<p> We're counting the day's for the return of Sex In The City on our screens.
    Although I'm sure, I can speak for the rest of us; when I say that 
it's so sad that  <q> Samantha</q> will not be joining the gang 😢. Samantha was the life
of the party and the group, she was for sure the<i> WILD ONE</i>
she can not be replaced.</p>

<h2> Do you think they will mention <q><i>Samantha</i></q>?</h2>

<form>
<label for="yes"><input id="yes" type="radio" name="yes-no"> Yes</label>
<label for="no"><input id="no" type="radio" name="no-yes"> No</label><br>

<h3> Things we should expect in the series</h3>

<ul>
    <li> The fashions!!!</li>
    <li> The fallouts (who's it going to be?)</li>
    <li> The sex? 🤷🏾‍♀️ 
        (I guess relationship sex because everyone married) </li>

</ul>

<p> I will say as a black women I enjoyed the show so much but I would love
    more diversity in casting, hopefully we see  more people of colour.</p>
    

  <p><q> After all, seasons change, so do cities. 
    People come into your life and people go. But it’s comforting 
    to know that the ones you love are always in your heart, and if
    you’re very lucky, a plane ride away.   </q> - Carrie. 
    <i><b>AND JUST LIKE THAT...</b></i> We shall be waiting.</p>
